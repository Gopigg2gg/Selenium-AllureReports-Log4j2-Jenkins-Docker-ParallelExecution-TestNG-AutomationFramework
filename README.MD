# Test Automation Architecture using Java and Selenium WebDriver

## Languages and Frameworks

This project using the following languages and frameworks:

* [Java 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) as the programming language
* [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) as the UnitTest framework to support the test creation
* [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) as the web browser automation framework using the Java binding
* [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/) as the fluent assertion library
* [Allure Report](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) as the testing report strategy
* [JavaFaker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker) as the faker data generation strategy
* [Log4J2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) as the logging management strategy
* [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) as the Selenium binaries management
* [Owner](http://owner.aeonbits.org/) to minimize the code to handle the properties file


## Test architecture

We know that any automation project starting with a good test architecture.
This project can be your initial test architecture for a faster start.
You will see the following items in this architecture:

* [Page Objects pattern](#page-objects-pattern)
* [Execution types](#execution-types)
* [BaseTest](#basetest)
* [TestListener](#testlistener)
* [Logging](#logging)
* [Configuration files](#configuration-files)
* [Parallel execution](#parallel-execution)
* [Test Data Factory](#test-data-factory)
* [Profiles executors on pom.xml](#profiles-executors-on-pomxml)
* [Pipeline as a code](#pipeline-as-a-code)


### Page Objects pattern
Page Object is a Design Pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. 

The Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantages:

There is a clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators (or their use if youâ€™re using a UI Map) and layout.
There is a single repository for the services or operations offered by the page rather than having these services scattered throughout the tests.

#### AbstractPageObject
This class has a protected constructor to remove the necessity to init the elements using the Page Factory. 
Also, it sets the timeout from the `timeout` property value located on `general.properties` file.

All the Page Object classes should extend the `AbstractPageObject`.
It also tries to remove the `driver` object from the Page Object class as much as possible.

### Execution types

There are two execution types: **local** and **remote**.
The `TargetFactory` class will resolve the target execution based on the `target` property value located on `general.properties` file.
Its usage is placed on the `BaseWeb` class before each test execution.

#### Local execution
This execution type uses [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) class to instantiate the web browsers.
When the `target` is `local` the `createDriver()` method is used from the `BrowserFactory` class to return the browser instance.

The browser used in the test is placed on the `browser` property in the `local.properties` file.

#### Remote execution
This execution is based on any Selenium Grid approach to execute the tests in remote machines (local or remote/cloud grid).
When the `target` is `remote` the `getOptions` method is used from the `BrowserFactory` to return the browser option 
class as the remote execution needs the browser capability.
The `DriverFactory` class has an internal method `createRemoteInstance` to return a `RemoteWebDriver` instance based on 
the browser capability.

You must pay attention to the two required information regarding the remote execution: the `grid.url` and `grid.port`
property values on the `grid.properties` file. You must update these values before the start.

If you are using the `docker-compose.yml` file to start the Zalenium grid, the values on the `grid.property` file should work.

Please take a look at the [Parallel Execution](#parallel-execution) section.

#### BrowserFactory class
This Factory class is a Java enum that has all implemented browsers to use during the test execution.
Each browser is an enum, and each enum implements two methods:
* `createDriver()`: creates the browser instance for the local execution. The browser driver is automatically managed by the WebDriverManager library
* `getOptions()`: creates a new browser Options setting some specific configurations. It's used for the remote executions

You can see that the `createDriver()` method used the `getOptions()` to use specific configuration, as starting the browser maximized and others.
The `getOptions()` is also used for the remote execution as it is a subclass of the `AbstractDriverOptions` and can be 
automatically accepted as either a `Capabilities` or `MutableCapabilities` class, which is required by the `RemoteWebDriver` class.

#### DriverManager class
create a `ThreadLocal` for the WebDriver instance, to make sure there's no conflict when we run it in parallel.

### BaseTest
This testing pattern was implemented on the [BaseWeb]
class to automatically run the pre (setup) and post (teardown) conditions.

The pre-condition uses `@BeforeMethod` from TestNG creates the browser instance based on the values passed either local or remote execution.
The post-condition uses `@AfterMethod` to close the browser instance.
Both have the `alwaysRun` parameter as `true` to force the run on a pipeline.

Pay attention that it was designed to open a browser instance to each `@Test` located on the test class.

This class also the `TestListener` that is a custom TestNG listener, and will be described in the next section.

### TestListener

The `TestListener` is a class that implements [ITestListener](https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#logging-listeners).
The following method is used to help logging errors and attach additional information to the test report:
* `onTestStart`: add the browser information into the test report
* `onTestFailure`: log the exceptions and add a screenshot to the test report
* `onTestSkipped`: add the skipped test on the log

### Logging
All the log is done by the Log4J using the `@Log4j2` annotation.

The `log4j2.properties` has two strategies: console and file.
A file with all the log information will be automatically created on the user folder with `test_automation.log` filename. 
If you want to change it, update the `appender.file.fileName` property value.

The `log.error` is used to log all the exceptions this architecture might throw. Use `log.info` or `log.debug` to log 
important information, like the users, automatically generated by the factory [LoginDataFactory]

### Parallel execution
The parallel test execution is based on the [parallel tests](https://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#parallel-tests) 
feature on TestNG. This is used by `parallel.xml` test suite file which has the `parallel="tests"` attribute and value, 
whereas `test` item inside the test suite will execute in parallel.
The browser in use for each `test` should be defined by a parameter, like:
```xml
<parameter name="browser" value="chrome"/>
```

You can define any parallel strategy.

It can be an excellent combination together with the grid strategy.

### Configuration files
This project uses a library called [Owner](http://owner.aeonbits.org/). You can find the class related to the property 
file reader in the following classes:
* [Configuration]
* [ConfigurationManager]

There are 3 properties (configuration) files located on `src/test/java/resources/`:
* `general.properties`: general configuration as the target execution, base url, timeout, and faker locale
* `grid.properties`: url and port for the Selenium grid usage (Zalenium)
* `local.properties`:  browser to use in the local execution

The properties were divided into three different ones to better separate the responsibilities and enable the changes easy 
without have a lot of properties inside a single file.

### Profiles executors on pom.xml

There is a profile called `web-execution` created to execute the test suite `local.xml` inside `src/test/resources/suites` folder.
To execute this suite, via the command line you can call the parameter `-P` and the profile id.

Eg: executing the multi_browser suite
``` bash
mvn test -Pweb-execution -Dtestng.dtd.http=true 
```

If you have more than one suite on _src/test/resources/suites_ folder you can parameterize the xml file name.
To do this you need:

* Create a property on `pom.xml` called _suite_

```xml
    <properties>
        <suite>local</suite>
    </properties>
```

* Change the profile id

```xml
<profile>
   <id>web-execution</id>
</profile>   
```

* Replace the xml file name to `${suite}` on the profile

```xml
<configuration>
   <suiteXmlFiles>
      <suiteXmlFile>src/test/resources/suites/${suite}.xml</suiteXmlFile>
   </suiteXmlFiles>
</configuration>
```

* Use `-Dsuite=suite_name` to call the suite

````bash
mvn test -Pweb-execution -Dsuite=parallel -Dtestng.dtd.http=true 
````

### Pipeline as a code

The two files of the pipeline as a code are inside `pipeline_as_code` folder.

* GitHub Actions to use it inside the GitHub located at `.github\workflows`
* Jenkins: `Jenkinsfile` to be used on a Jenkins pipeline located at `pipeline_as_code`


### Report

* Navigae to the root folder in terminal
* enter `mvn allure:serve` 
* The report will be genereated locally and opens in Browser
